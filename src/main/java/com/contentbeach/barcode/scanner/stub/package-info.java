/**
 * Contains a barcode scanner stub
 * class ({@link com.contentbeach.barcode.scanner.stub.BarcodeScannerStub})
 * that uses the {@link com.contentbeach.jna.input.keyboard.KeyboardSendInputHelper}
 * to send keyboard events to a Windows-based application window
 * (the window must be open and not minimized).
 * <p>
 *     This was developed for use on a developer workstation that does not
 *     have an attached barcode scanner.  It is intended to be used as a
 *     barcode scanner <em>stub</em> that sends pre-determined barcode text
 *     to a specific application window.
 * </p>
 * <p>Usage:</p>
 * <p><code>java -jar Stub.jar &lt;window_title&gt; &lt;barcode&gt;</code></p>
